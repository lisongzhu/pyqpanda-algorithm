## Core Features
1. **Modularity & High Reusability**
   All algorithms are organized as independent modules for on-demand invocation. For example, QAOA, Grover's, and QSVM can be imported and used independently, supporting reuse across different projects.
2. **High-Performance Implementation**
   Domain-specific algorithms are optimized and engineered for acceleration. Combined with QPanda3's underlying optimizations (e.g., OriginBIS instruction set, hardware-aware compilation), execution efficiency on simulators and real quantum hardware is significantly improved.
3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**
   Deeply integrated with the QPanda3 framework, it supports running on CPU simulators, quantum cloud services (e.g., Origin Wukong), and real quantum processors, enabling "write once, deploy anywhere".
4. **Comprehensive Documentation & Examples**
   Detailed API docs, usage examples, and annotated code lower the learning barrier, making it ideal for beginners and researchers to quickly start with machine learning and combinatorial optimization tasks.
5. **Strong Ecosystem Integration**
   Seamlessly integrates with other Origin Quantum toolchains (e.g., VQNet, Origin Wukong, Origin Liangyu), supporting the full workflow from algorithm design to actual execution.

## Package Categories
### 1. Optimization & Search Algorithms
Suitable for combinatorial optimization and large-scale search problems (e.g., path planning, resource scheduling, portfolio optimization).
- **QUBO (Unconstrained Binary Optimization)**  
  Converts combinatorial optimization problems into quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems (a universal modeling form for quantum annealing and variational quantum algorithms).
- **QAOA (Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm)**  
  A hybrid quantum-classical variational algorithm that approximates QUBO solutions by optimizing parameterized quantum circuits (Ansatz), applicable to Max-Cut, Max-SAT, etc.
- **Grover's Search Algorithm**  
  Achieves quadratic speedup for target item search in unstructured databases. Amplitude amplification reduces search complexity from `N` to $O(\sqrt{N})$.

### 2. Machine Learning & Data Mining Algorithms
Integrates quantum computing into classical machine learning to improve efficiency and accuracy of classification, clustering, regression, etc.
- **QSVM (Quantum Support Vector Machine)**  
  A classification model based on quantum kernel functions, enabling optimal classification boundaries in high-dimensional spaces.
- **QSVR (Quantum Support Vector Regression)**  
  A regression model for fitting continuous variables (e.g., time series prediction).
- **QKMeans (Quantum K-Means Clustering)**  
  Quantum-accelerated large-scale data clustering for high-dimensional data scenarios.
- **QPCA (Quantum Principal Component Analysis)**  
  Extracts data principal components via quantum circuits to accelerate dimensionality reduction.
- **QMRMR (Quantum Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance)**  
  Implements efficient feature selection to reduce redundant feature interference.
- **QARM (Quantum Association Rule Mining)**  
  Rapidly mines frequent itemsets and association rules (e.g., market basket analysis).

### 3. Scientific Computing & Numerical Solution Algorithms
Solves key problems in physical modeling and engineering simulation (e.g., eigenvalues, linear equations, matrix decomposition).
- **VQE (Variational Quantum Eigensolver)**  
  Solves Hamiltonian ground state energy via variational methods (widely used in quantum chemistry simulation).
- **HHL (Quantum Linear System Solver)**  
  Achieves exponential speedup for solving $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ in sparse, well-conditioned linear systems.
- **QSVD (Quantum Variational Singular Value Decomposition)**  
  Extracts matrix singular values/vectors under a variational framework (for dimensionality reduction and recommendation systems).

### 4. General Tools & Basic Components
Provides underlying tools for quantum computing workflows.
- **QAE (Quantum Amplitude Estimation)**  
  Precisely estimates target state amplitude/measurement probability with quadratic speedup (e.g., financial derivative pricing, risk assessment).
- **Comparator (Quantum Comparator)**  
  Implements numerical comparison or threshold judgment to build quantum decision logic.
- **SparseAmp (Sparse Amplitude Encoding)**  
  Efficiently encodes sparse vectors into quantum states, reducing quantum resource consumption (for data preprocessing).
